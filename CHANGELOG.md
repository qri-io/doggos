The `doggos` package takes a base58 hash, a list of dog breeds, and a list of colors and comes up with a color/dog breed combination from the base58 hash.

This is the first proper release of `doggos`. In preparation for go 1.13, in which `go.mod` files and go modules are the primary way to handle go dependencies, we are going to do an official release of all our modules. This will be version v0.1.0 of `doggos`.
